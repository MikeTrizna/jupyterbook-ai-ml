# Overview

Artificial Intelligence (or AI) has already become prevalent in our daily lives -- from recommendation engines that suggest the next movie to stream, to predictive text that can finish your sentence in emails or text messages. A lot of the technology behind some of these applications are available as open source products, and can be modified to perform research-based or administrative tasks that are specific to the unique types of work that Smithsonian employees do.

However, in order to make sure that AI is adopted ethically, responsibly, and effectively, we want to give you the literacy you will need to critically evaluate AI technologies.

## Target Audience

This workshop is open to any Smithsonian badge holders at any Smithsonian Unit. We think that any Smithsonian staff member, intern or fellow can benefit from participating in this workshop.
