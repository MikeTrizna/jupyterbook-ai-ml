# 2: What are AI and Machine Learning?

---

## What are AI and Machine Learning?

We use these 2 terms interchangeably a lot, but there are actually subtle differences.

---

## Artificial Intelligence Definition

When a computer is able to make decisions that mimic how a human would.

---

## AI Example: Clippy

---

## AI Example: SPAM filter

---

## Machine Learning Definition

A subset of AI, where decision rules are formulated from data examples.

---

## Machine Learning is a subset of AI

(Add a new Venn Diagram here)

---

## Clippy and SPAM filter revisited

---

**Activity**: 

* What abilities would an AI-only (not using Machine Learning) thermostat have, versus a "smart" thermostat like a Nest?
* Can you think of another example of hardware or software that can be considered AI, but not necessarily based on machine learning?

---

## What is a Machine Learning model?

Use a grading or job application rubric as example

---

## How is a Machine Learning model built?

* First, identify the prediction to make, and how to measure its correctness.
* Examine the example data, and try to identify "features". *Domain expertise is important here.*
* Either randomly subset part of the data for testing, or identify a new set of data for that.
* Train a model. Depending on the algorithm, go through an iterative process of adjusting weights to maximize your measure of correctness.
* Try it out. Do the predictions make sense? Look at near-misses. Can features be added or removed to reduce confusion?
* Loop back as needed.
